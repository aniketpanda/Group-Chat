This project is a basic implementation of group chat application. A local apache server must be running with the chat_final folder being copied to htdocs folder. Then there are 4 ch.html files which needs to be opened in different tabs. Now whatever is typed in chat will be shown in each of the tabs. This is implemented using Server Side Events. And even images can be sent through this chat using CORS. 
The server.php has Events called 'data' and 'images' and each ch.html is listening to these events generated from the server. The event 'data' is caused on change/modtime in chat.txt which is updated when any user types and sends in their respective chat. The event 'image' is caused on update to image.txt same as chat.txt. 
Each upload from image causes that image to be moved to the local directory of images in htdocs and then displayed in the chat.
